Border DataScience
📊 Project Description

Border DataScience is a Python-based project focused on analyzing and reporting data related to cross-border traffic in Poland.
The goal is to build an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline and apply machine learning models to analyze trends, detect anomalies, and improve data quality and decision-making.

⚙️ Main Features

🔄 ETL Process — automated extraction, cleaning, and transformation of border traffic data.

🧹 Data Validation and Error Reporting — detecting missing or inconsistent values and generating error logs.

📈 Data Analysis and Visualization — generating interactive reports and charts using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

🤖 Machine Learning — implementing regression and ensemble models such as RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, and StackingRegressor, CatBoostRegressor to predict and analyze traffic patterns.

📦 Monthly Aggregation and Reporting — summarizing passenger flow by direction, border crossing, and transport type.
